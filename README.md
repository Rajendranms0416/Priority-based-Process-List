# PCB Priority List (C)
Simple priority-sorted singly linked list to model basic Process Control Blocks.

## Features
- Priority-ordered insertion (lower number = higher priority)
- Menu-based Insert / Delete / Display
- Pointer-based dynamic memory management

## Build & Run
gcc -o pcb pcb.c
./pcb

## Next steps
- Add process state field (alive/dead)
- Implement remove-by-state and persist to file
